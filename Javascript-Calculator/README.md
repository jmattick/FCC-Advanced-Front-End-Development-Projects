First project of Free Code Camp's Advance Front-End Development Projects

3 User Stories: 
(1) I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
(2) I can clear the input field with a clear button.
(3) I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

I decided to personalize my calculator by emulating a desk with a cup of coffee and a notepad on it. I improved my drawing with css when I was making the cup of coffee and the notepad I made is functional so that a user can type anything into it.
