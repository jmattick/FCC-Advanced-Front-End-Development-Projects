# Tic-Tac-Toe

In-progress: https://codepen.io/jmatty16/full/pwpxdX/

Third project for free code camp's advanced Front-End Development Projects. 

Three user stories: 

(1) I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.

(2) My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.

(3) I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

I decided I wanted to make the game more interesting because once you become good at it it is almost impossible to lose. In order to make it more difficult, I added an extreme mode which will spin the tic-tac-toe board while the user is playing. In the future I want to develop an artificial intelligence for the computers turn to make the game unbeatable.
