# Pomodoro Clock

View Here: https://codepen.io/jmatty16/full/LLzKvP/

Second Project in Free Code Camp's Advanced Front-End Development Challenges

3 User stories: 

(1) I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.

(2) I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.

(3) I can customize the length of each pomodoro.

For this project I wanted to improve my skills using HTML5 Canvas, so in addition to required stories I incorporated a growing section of a circle to represent time on the clock.
